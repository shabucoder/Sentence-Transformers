    "\n",
    "#### **Pooling Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice:** Mean Pooling (default in `SentenceTransformer`)\n",
    "- **Reasoning:** Averages token embeddings to create a fixed-length sentence embedding, balancing simplicity and effectiveness in capturing semantic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Framework**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice:** PyTorch which offers dynamic computation graphs and is widely supported in the NLP community, facilitating easy integration and customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pre-trained Model Utilization**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice:** Leveraged a pre-trained `distilbert-base-uncased` model\n",
    "- **Reasoning:** Utilizes transfer learning to benefit from extensive training on large datasets, reducing the need for extensive computational resources and training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Embedding Output Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Choice:** Outputs embeddings as PyTorch tensors\n",
    "- **Reasoning:** Ensures compatibility with downstream tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) or Sentiment Analysis, where tensor operations are essential.\n"
